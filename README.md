I recently built a Customer Churn Dashboard using Power BI, designed to provide deep insights into customer behavior and retention trends. This dashboard combines powerful data visualizations with custom DAX measures to help businesses understand where and why they’re losing customers—and how to act on it.

The dashboard opens with a snapshot of the total customer base, giving a clear view of how many customers are retained versus those who have churned. From there, it breaks down customer trends by gender. Interestingly, male customers show a slightly higher retention rate, while female customers have a marginally higher churn percentage. These subtle differences offer a starting point for targeted engagement strategies.

Age group analysis provides even more clarity. Younger customers, particularly those under 30, tend to stay with the company, showing strong retention rates. However, as age increases, especially between 51 and 60 years, the likelihood of churn rises significantly. This could reflect shifting financial priorities or customer satisfaction issues that emerge with time.

The dashboard also looks into the number of products customers hold. Those with just one or three products seem more likely to churn, whereas customers who use two products are more committed. This insight supports the strategy of cross-selling the right mix of services to enhance customer stickiness.

Tenure plays a crucial role too. Long-standing customers who’ve been with the company for more than five years tend to be much more loyal, while newer customers are at a higher risk of churning. This emphasizes the importance of early customer engagement and onboarding experiences.

Financial factors were another layer of the analysis. Customers with higher account balances and stronger credit scores are generally more stable and loyal. On the other hand, customers with lower credit scores or very minimal balances tend to churn more often, possibly due to financial instability or dissatisfaction with product offerings.

Finally, geography shows an interesting pattern. French customers show strong retention, while customers in Germany and Spain display varying churn risks. These geographical differences suggest that customer service, market fit, or regional preferences could be influencing satisfaction levels.

This dashboard isn’t just about visualizing data—it’s a strategic tool for understanding customer lifecycles, predicting risk, and proactively improving customer retention. I’m proud of how this project blends storytelling with analytics, turning raw data into meaningful business intelligence.
